The solution involves refining Firebase Realtime Database security rules for better error messages. Instead of a generic denial, the rules should include specific checks and potentially custom error messages.  Here's an example of improved security rules:

```javascript
// Security Rules
{
  "rules": {
    "users": {
      "$uid": {
        //Check if the user is authenticated
        '.read': "auth != null && $uid === auth.uid",
        '.write': "auth != null && $uid === auth.uid"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

These rules explicitly check if the user is authenticated and if the user ID matches the authenticated user.  Furthermore, we can add more specific error messages in the rules to handle the cases that the rules aren't met. 

Additionally, adding more verbose logging within your security rules can aid in debugging permission problems. This can help pinpoint the exact rule causing the issue.
