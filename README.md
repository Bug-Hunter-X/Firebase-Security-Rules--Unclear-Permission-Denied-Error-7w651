# Firebase Security Rules: Unclear Permission Denied Error

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when working with Firebase Realtime Database security rules.  The error, a generic 'Permission denied', provides insufficient information for debugging.

The problem occurs when the code attempts to read data, but the security rules don't grant the necessary permissions. The challenge is that the error message isn't precise about which rule is failing.

## Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up a Firebase project.
3. Configure your Firebase project credentials.
4. Run `firebaseBug.js`.  Observe the vague 'Permission denied' error message.
5. Refer to `firebaseBugSolution.js` for a solution which shows how to modify the security rules and make them more clear to ensure that correct permissions are granted to resolve the issue.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully examining the Firebase security rules and adding more specific rules to avoid the vague permission denial error.  Adding more detailed logging within the Firebase security rules can help with the debugging process.
